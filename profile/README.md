# Materials Nexus

We are transforming materials R&D

Using AI and advanced quantum calculations we are accelerating new material discovery and design.

The importance of advanced materials is critical as we move to net-zero, yet their social, environmental and economic costs are high and significant performance improvements are essential.

Finding next-generation materials that are more accessible, less damaging and more effective through traditional methods requires decades of research which is too slow for our imminent needs.

Our ground-breaking software can accurately and rapidly model new material properties to accelerate development of next-generation materials for a net-zero world.
