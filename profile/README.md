# Materials Nexus

Our revolutionary modelling platform, born out of research at Cambridge University, accelerates materials research and development by harnessing the power of AI. 
We work with partners who are active in material R&D, enabling them to use our unprecedented speed and accuracy to increase their understanding of how their materials work, how to improve them, and how to design new more sustainable materials.
